  "summary": "The diff adds a large set of new frontend UI/3D scene files and a stub Motoko backend actor, but it does not provide evidence of rerunning/fixing the build & deployment pipeline or addressing a specific build/deploy configuration issue. Several newly added user-facing features appear beyond the stated goal of only fixing build/deployment reliability.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Re-run the full build and deployment process for the existing Unity-style 3D car controller app and ensure the deployment completes successfully without errors.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows new source files added; it contains no evidence of build/deploy being executed or of changes that directly ensure deployment completes and the deployed app loads without runtime issues.",
      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff>: Added files only; no CI/deploy scripts/logs/config changes shown",

      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "If the build/deployment fails again, identify and fix the underlying build or deployment configuration issue so subsequent builds and deployments succeed reliably.",
      "reason": "No specific build/deployment failure is identified and no build/deployment configuration or tooling changes (e.g., dfx config, package scripts, pipeline config) are shown in the diff summary; instead, many application features are added.",
      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff>: No modified files; only 19 added files",

      "reason": "BuildRequest REQ-7/REQ-8 are about build/deployment retry and fixing build/deploy configuration issues without adding new user-facing features; the diff adds substantial new UI and gameplay/scene code.",
