# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Re-run the full build and deployment for the existing Unity-style 3D car controller app and ensure it deploys successfully without errors.

**Planned changes:**
- Re-run a clean build to confirm there are no compile/type errors.
- Re-run deployment and verify it completes without deployment errors.
- If failures occur, identify and apply the minimal build/deployment configuration fixes required to make builds/deployments succeed reliably (repeatable at least twice) without adding new user-facing features.

**User-visible outcome:** The deployed app loads in the browser successfully (no blank screen or runtime crash).
